One way for handling retrieving and displaying data from an API is to route a user to a component, and then in that componentâ€™s ngOnInit hook call a method in a service to get the necessary data. While getting the data, perhaps the component can show a loading indicator.

There is another way to use what is known as a route resolver, which allows you to get data before navigating to the new route.

Steps:
1. npx @angular/cli new angular-route-resolvers-example --style=css --routing --skip-tests

2. ng generate resolver news

3. ng generate component home

4. ng generate component top
